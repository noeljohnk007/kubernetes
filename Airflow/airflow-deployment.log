###########################################################
#  WARNING: You should set a static webserver secret key  #
###########################################################

You are using a dynamically generated webserver secret key, which can lead to
unnecessary restarts of your Airflow components.

Information on how to set a static webserver secret key can be found here:
https://airflow.apache.org/docs/helm-chart/stable/production-guide.html#webserver-secret-key
